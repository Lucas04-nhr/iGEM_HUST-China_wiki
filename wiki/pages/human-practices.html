                   <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle1">Topic Selection: Climate Crisis Awareness</h1>
                        <p>At present, a trend of rising summer temperatures is apparent, impacting not only tropical and subtropical regions but also extending to the Arctic, where the average temperature has reached an astonishing 30°C in summer. This phenomenon is a clear component of the broader issue of global warming, prompting HUST-China to launch an investigation within the field of global warming and gradually intensify our efforts to identify key contributors to this pressing issue.</p>
                        <p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR6 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2023, the global surface temperature has already increased by 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. The IPCC states that the observed global warming is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), especially CO2. It is further noted that for every 0.5°C increase in global temperature, climate issues such as extreme heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and regional droughts become more frequent and severe. Simultaneously, the latest data from the World Resources Institute indicates that the current concentration of CO2 on Earth is the highest it has been in nearly two million years. Over the past decade, Earth has experienced warmer temperatures than at any point in the last 125,000 years. </p>
                        <p>因为气温的不断攀升，全球约有一半人口每年至少有一个月面临严重缺水；居住在全球干旱地区的9.5亿人口将面临用水压力、中暑和荒漠化等一系列问题[1]。同时，全球气候变暖将带来大规模的冰川融化，造成不可逆转的海平面上升，当前北极夏季冰川的覆盖面积已达近1000年来的最小值，海平面上升速度超过了近3000年来的任何一个世纪。不仅如此，气温升高还会带来全球粮食产量下降，加剧疟疾、病毒等传播疾病的蔓延，进一步危害人类安全与健康[2]。因此 </p>
                        <p>Addressing the greenhouse effect is an urgent imperative.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) highlighted in its Greenhouse Gas Bulletin 2021 that fossil fuel consumption is the predominant source of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Notably, China's heavy reliance on coal for electricity production has played a significant role in contributing to this issue. According to the China Energy Statistical Yearbook 2022, coal consumption accounted for 55.9% of the country's total energy consumption. Furthermore, in the production and supply of electric power and heat, coal consumption constituted 55.8% of the total consumption. This substantial reliance on coal has led to significant CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. </p>
                        <p>Therefore, our team has directed its attention towards coal-fired power plants, with the expectation that our project can offer practical applications and address on-site challenges.</p>
                    <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle2">Background Investigation: Current CCUS Landscape Navigation and Project Shaping</h1>
                    <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the current state of carbon emissions, we consulted Professor Cong Luo from the State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion at HUST, who is at the forefront of research to support China's National Carbon Neutral Strategy. His work encompasses both carbon capture and carbon utilization, with a focus on absorption capture, adsorption capture, oxy-fuel combustion capture and chemical utilization. Furthermore, Professor Cong Luo is a pioneer in developing low-carbon technological innovations in sectors like thermal power generation and alternative fuel vehicles.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4595/wiki/safety/safety4-1.png" alt="" class="normimg" >
                        <i class="imgexplain">Figure 1. Professor Cong LUO</i>
                        <p>In our discussion with Professor Cong Luo, we delved into the various methods currently employed for carbon fixation, which primarily encompass physical, chemical, and biological approaches.</p>
                         <p>Traditional physical methods for CO2 capture involve the use of physical adsorbents. These methods depend on adjusting operational parameters like temperature and pressure to facilitate the fixation of CO2. While they have the advantage of simplicity and the ability to reuse adsorbents, they also come with certain drawbacks, such as the need for a significant quantity of adsorbents and potential limitations in achieving the desired level of selectivity. Chemical methods involve converting CO2 into solid compounds through chemical reactions. However, they face challenges such as high energy consumption, often necessitating high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, as well as limited selectivity. </p>
                          <p>Both physical and chemical methods exhibit limitations in terms of environmental sustainability and CO2 selectivity. Hence, biological approaches emerge as a promising alternative. We intend to employ synthetic biological approaches to tackle these challenges. </p>
                           <p>Professor Cong Luo also provided us with a detailed introduction to Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technology. CCUS involves the capture of CO2, generally from large point sources like power generation or industrial facilities that use either fossil fuels or biomass as fuel. If not being used on-site, the captured CO2 is compressed and transported by pipeline, ship, rail or truck to be used in a range of applications, or injected into deep geological formations such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs or saline aquifers. CCUS technology plays a crucial role in supporting carbon-neutral initiatives and achieving Net Zero emissions by effectively reducing greenhouse gas CO2 emissions. </p>
                           <p>According to the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15) released by IPCC, by 2030 and 2050, global CCUS capacity will reach 100–400 million tons yr–1 and 3–6.8 billion tons yr–1, respectively. Furthermore, data from the 2021 Annual Report on CO2 Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in China shows that 40 CCUS model projects are now in operation or under construction in China, with a CCUS capacity of 3 million tons yr–1.</p>
                           <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4595/wiki/safety/safety4-1.png" alt="" class="normimg" >
                        <i class="imgexplain">Figure 2. Geological distribution of CCUS projects in China</i>
                        <p>Professor Cong Luo mentioned that most of the current CCUS projects involve separate methods for CO2 capture and utilization. This inspired us to explore the possibility of integrating CO2 capture and utilization in our project, thereby innovating and making meaningful contributions in the realms of carbon neutrality.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, Professor Luo guided us through a tour of the State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, where we observed experimental equipment for oxy-fuel combustion capture. He explained that this method enables the enrichment of CO2 in flue gas, making its separation and capture more feasible. Nevertheless, he also pointed out the downsides of oxy-fuel combustion capture, notably the high costs and energy consumption. We brainstormed the idea of addressing this challenge by using synthetic biology approaches, offering the advantage of low microorganism cultivation costs. Moreover, synthetic biology approaches enable the construction of high-yield strains, significantly improving production efficiency. This approach might provide a novel solution to the climate crisis.</p>

                        <p>In addition to gathering background knowledge from academia, we have established connections with various government agencies, including the Department of Ecology and Environment in Hubei Province, as well as cities like Wuhan, Yichang, Sanmenxia, and Zhengzhou. Through these connections, we have gained valuable insights into the current air quality in these regions and the strategies being employed to reduce CO2 emissions. This information has deepened our understanding of the project's background.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we have consulted experts from hongyuan3E , a renowned carbon accounting tool developed by a leading team of experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This tool provides professional services to both national and local Departments of Ecology and Environment, supporting carbon neutrality efforts. Through this collaboration, we have acquired CO2 emissions data for over 400 cities in China, spanning from 2000 to 2021. This data serves as a crucial foundation for our comprehensive assessment of CO2 emissions levels and their changing trends across different regions.</p>
                    <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle3">Project Initial Design: Functional Concept and Pathway Establishment </h1>
                        <p>After gathering sufficient background information, we initiated the project design intending to provide a solution to address the climate crisis issue. Following a thorough literature review, we chose the synechocystis PCC 6803 and S. oneidensis MR-1 as our engineered microbial strains. 
We intended to use cyanobacteria to absorb CO2 and produce lactate, which would then serve as the carbon source for electricity generation by Shewanella.
</p>
 <p>Through genetic engineering, we aim to enhance lactate production by cyanobacteria and improve Shewanella's electricity-generating capacity. For cyanobacteria, we introduced the LdhA gene. An extensive literature review confirmed that introducing the LdhA gene enabled lactate production, a concept validated in previous studies. Additionally, we introduced the LldP gene to facilitate the transport of lactate from the intracellular to the extracellular space, making it accessible for uptake by Shewanella. Furthermore, we incorporated the Omcs gene, encoding an electron transfer protein. This protein redirects electrons from PQ to Cytb6f, reducing NADH consumption by repressing the electron transfer chain RET, ultimately increasing lactate production. For Shewanella, we introduced five genes—ycel, pncB, nadM, nadD*, and nadE*—to enhance its electricity generation capabilities. Additionally, the Oprf protein was introduced to assist in the transport of riboflavin, enhancing electron transfer efficiency. Detailed design specifics can be found in the Design section.
</p>
<p>After finalizing our selection of cyanobacterial strains, we reached out to the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, seeking their support in obtaining Synechocystis PCC 6803. They graciously shared their cultivation methods and experience with this cyanobacterial strain.
</p>
<p>Professor Yunjun Yan, from the School of Life Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, is an expert in cyanobacteria research. After reviewing our project, he acknowledged the feasibility of our design and provided valuable suggestions to enhance production efficiency. Specifically, he recommended the use of AuNPs (Gold Nanoparticles) during cyanobacterial cultivation to expedite electron transfer and improve photosynthetic efficiency.

                        <p>Our instructor, Xiaoman Xie, who specializes in enhancing Shewanella's electricity generation capabilities, recommended the incorporation of rGO to form a 3D structure with the biofilm. This would increase the local riboflavin concentration and facilitate electron transfer, ultimately enhancing Shewanella's electricity generation.

<h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle4">Project Design Refinement: Functional Optimization and Component Enhancement</h1>
                        <p>After recognizing the importance and viability of our project, we engaged in discussions with Professor Abdelghani Sghir from Université d'Évry Val-d'Essonne(UEVE), Université Paris-Saclay. Recognizing the potential presence of emissions such as SO2 and nitrogen compounds in coal-fired power plants, which could harm our engineered microorganisms, we sought guidance from Professor Abdelghani for advice to refine our design. He recommended the incorporation of resistant genes to enhance the survivability of our engineered strains. </p>
                        <p>After conducting a thorough literature review, we decided to overexpress the GshA and GshB genes in cyanobacteria to enhance their antioxidative capabilities. Additionally, we introduced the SOD gene into Shewanella to mitigate cellular damage caused by ROS. Furthermore, we introduced the Dsup gene into both engineered strains to protect their DNA from damage.</p>

                        <p>After making further improvements to our project design, our team members met with Professor Abdelghani again in France. We updated him on our project's current progress, and he acknowledged the feasibility of our resistance component design. During this meeting, we also sought advice on improving the efficiency of CO2 absorption. Professor Abdelghani recommended we increase the CO2 concentration  , offering valuable insights for our hardware development in the upcoming phases.</p>
