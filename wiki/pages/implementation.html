                        <p>According to the "AR6 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2023" released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is evident that anthropogenic activities have led to a global temperature increase of 1.1°C. It is well-established that with every 0.5°C rise in global temperatures, there is an escalation in the frequency and severity of climate phenomena such as extreme heatwaves, intense rainfall events, and regional droughts. Furthermore, recent data from the World Resources Institute indicates that carbon dioxide concentrations on Earth have reached their highest levels in millions of years. The planet has been warmer over the past decade than at any time in the last 125,000 years.</p>
                    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4595/wiki/safety/safety4-1.png" alt="" class="normimg" >
                        <i class="imgexplain">Figure 1. Global warming status and trends</i>
                        <p>Due to the continuous increase in global temperatures, approximately half of the world's population will encounter severe challenges in terms of water scarcity, heat-related illnesses, and land degradation. Coastal regions will also face heightened vulnerability to natural disasters such as extreme flooding and storms caused by rising sea levels. Furthermore, elevated temperatures will contribute to a decline in global food production and exacerbate the transmission of vector-borne diseases like malaria, West Nile virus, and Lyme disease, posing significant threats to human safety and well-being.</p>
                        <p>The combustion of fossil fuels and their low energy efficiency are identified as the primary contributors to global warming and numerous climate crises. According to the 2021 Greenhouse Gas Bulletin released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), burning fossil fuels remains the predominant source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere [3]. The report emphasizes that 'reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal, oil, and natural gas' ranks third among promising mitigation measures, following 'utilizing solar energy' and 'generating electricity from wind power'. Furthermore, the report proposed several policy recommendations to governments worldwide.It advocates for a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel usage while implementing carbon capture and storage technology within existing fossil fuel systems alongside enhancing energy efficiency. These measures are considered indispensable for humanity's future response to global warming.</p>

                    <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle2">END-USER ANALYSIS</h1>
                     <p>We expect our users to consist of three main groups: thermal power plants, carbon sequestration research teams, and other iGEM teams.</p>
                    <h2 class="subtitle" id="list1">1.Thermal power plant</h2>
                        <p>According to the latest data, China currently possesses over 3,000 thermal power plants. In 2022, the actual carbon emissions resulting from thermal power generation in China amounted to 4.85 billion tons, constituting approximately half of the nation's total CO2 emissions for that year. Therefore, in the current situation where it is difficult to rapidly reconstruct China's energy structure, how to address the significant carbon emissions from thermal power generation has become a key issue that our project aims to improve.</p>
                        <p>In reality, thermal power plants initially remove pollutants such as sulfur dioxide from the exhaust gases before releasing them into the atmosphere through chimneys. This project introduces a strain of cyanobacteria called Synechocystis PCC6803, which can efficiently absorb and utilize carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Additionally, by incorporating the Omcs gene, this project enhances the conversion efficiency of CO2 within Synechocystis PCC6803 cells, thereby promoting carbon sequestration in these Synechocystis PCC6803. Therefore, this application expects the thermal power plants to channel their waste gases into our designed fermentation tanks before releasing them through chimneys. Inside these tanks, the Synechocystis PCC6803 will efficiently absorb CO2, thereby reducing the carbon dioxide content in industrial emissions and playing a role in carbon sequestration and purification.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the LdhA-Lldp genes within the Synechocystis PCC6803 are capable of not only carbon dioxide into lactic acid but also efficiently transporting it to the culture medium. Subsequently, this lactic acid serves as a valuable energy source for Shewanella. By incorporating additional genes such as ycel, pncB, nadM,-nadD*-nadE*,Shewanella demonstrates enhanced electricity generation using lactic acid, effectively compensating for power loss resulting from inadequate coal utilization. Consequently, this approach significantly improves energy utilization efficiency while concurrently reducing carbon emissions and optimizing energy utilization structure.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4595/wiki/safety/safety4-1.png" alt="" class="normimg" >
                        <i class="imgexplain">Figure 3 Current hardware design diagram</i>
                        <p>Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the waste heat generated by thermal power plants can also meet the temperature requirements for fermenting tanks. Data confirms that the unemitted exhaust gas temperature from a thermal power plant ranges between 80-100°C. Our design incorporates this high-temperature waste gas into our system through a heat exchange pipeline (as shown in the diagram above), utilizing the heat exchange between the waste gas and culture medium to maintain the desired temperature for fermentation. This not growth conditions for our strains but also maximizes energy utilization by harnessing the waste heat resources of thermal power plants.</p>
                        <p>In our future vision for the project, we have introduced resilient genes such as GshA, GshB, SOD, and Dsup to prevent the toxic effects of trace amounts of gases like sulfur dioxide in exhaust fumes on bacteria. This empowers the bacterial strains with robust antioxidant and DNA damage resistance capabilities, ensuring their survival and meeting carbon sequestration needs.</p>
                        <h2 class="subtitle" id="list2">2.Carbon Sequestration Research Team</h2>
                        <p>Power plants primarily serve as applications for existing products, and their industrial nature limits their ability to upgrade and develop the functionality of these products. The application upgrades of the products are mainly carried out by domestic and international carbon capture laboratories and other research institutions. Therefore, we have decided to collaborate with relevant scientific research institutes in order to further develop our products.</p>
                         <p>The research team or scientific institutions will receive the plasmids and strains we have already constructed, along with our design specification. Researchers can then modify our target genes or vectors in order to achieve higher efficiency or additional functions. Alternatively, they can utilize our pre-constructed strains to develop new ways of utilizing energy (such as developing new forms of carbon source supply for Shewanella bacteria to improve biomass power generation). Additionally, we will send tracking teams to monitor the progress of the strains and provide guidance and communication on cultivation environment, hardware facilities, and other conditions.</p>
                          <p>We have already had communications with the Tianjin Industrial Biotechnology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Science(see HP section for details). This research institute is dedicated to developing carbon sequestration technology and improving carbon sequestration efficiency. We look forward to further communication and upgrades for this project in the future.</p>
                         <h2 class="subtitle" id="list3">  3.Other iGEM teams</h2>
                        <p>Not limited to the initial purpose of the project, our design of genes such as ycel, pncB, nadM for Shewanella is primarily based on increasing intracellular NADH levels to accelerate electron transfer and thereby enhance its electricity generation efficiency. The fundamental principle remains unchanged regardless of any modifications in project design. If other teams aim to improve the electricity generation efficiency of Shewanella, they can refer to our project design.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we have endowed bacteria with a resilience system consisting of GshA, GshB, SOD, and Dsup to enhance the DNA damage resistance. If other teams also require bacterial stress resistance, they can refer our resilience system.</p>
                        <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle3">Safety</h1>
                                               <p>Firstly, the two strains used in this project are considered safe as they are included in the iGEM strain whitelist, ensuring that there is no risk of contamination. Additionally, we plan to use nutrient-deficient strains in later stages of the project to further enhance safety measures. Moreover, our hardware only has gas inlet and outlet connections which are equipped with ultraviolet sterilization devices to prevent any potential release of the strains into the environment, thus ensuring the safety of the project.</p>
                                    <p>In terms of regulations and policies, according to Article 5(1) of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) by the World Trade Organization (WTO), it states that Members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are based on an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant international organizations.When conducting cross-regional exchanges and collaborations in this project, it is necessary to re-evaluate the safety of bacterial strains based on local quarantine and hygiene requirements. At the same time, efforts should be made to prevent any leakage of bacteria in the local area, thereby reducing the risk of cross-regional contamination.</p>           
                                   <p>According to Article 13 of the "Regulations on the Safety Management of Agricultural Genetically Modified Organisms" issued by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, before conducting productive experiments and industrialization plans for our project, it is necessary to conduct preliminary small-scale "intermediate trials" and medium-scale "environmental release experiments" in different pilot areas. This means that during the process from laboratory experimentation to industrialization, we need to select different trial sites in various environmental regions for field experiments in order to ensure that this genetically modified product will not contaminate the environment and is truly effective.</p>           
                                   <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle4">Future design</h1>
                                    <h2 class="subtitle" id="list4"> 1.Commercial analysis</h2>
                                    <p>In order to facilitate the practical application of our ideas in business production and daily life, we conducted a commercial analysis of this project using the SWOT framework from the field of economic management. This was done with the aim of establishing a solid theoretical foundation for the successful implementation of the project.  </p>

<p>Regarding the opportunities and advantages of the project, we believe that in the context of global warming, low-carbon emissions reduction has become a topic of concern for all countries. At the same time, China's recent policies have placed emphasis on carbon neutrality and environmental friendliness. While coal-fired power generation remains an important part in China's energy structure, this design has broad prospects for application. Not only that, but in the context of carbon trading market prices rising year by year, instead of spending a large amount of money to purchase carbon credits, we can utilize our energy-saving and emission-reducing projects to reduce operational costs for businesses, thereby making our designs more widely utilized.</p>
<p>And the selected strains for this project are commonly found and have low requirements for culture medium, which further reduces the operational costs of the company. Additionally, this project has a high carbon fixation efficiency and generates a large amount of electricity, offering broad prospects within the scope of power applications and bringing considerable profit conversion rate to the enterprise. Moreover, the product demonstrates high originality and patentability, significantly enhancing the innovative competitiveness of the company.</p>
<p>Regarding the shortcomings of the project, we believe that the high requirements for hardware equipment are due to the isolation and cultivation of two different strains in this project. Additionally, continuous cultivation has become an important cost consideration. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that with improvements in energy structure, the proportion of thermal power plants will inevitably decrease, resulting in a lack of reliance on the project's support system.</p>
<p>In response to the deficiencies and challenges of the product, we have analyzed and proposed the following solutions: for the issue of strain cultivation, a co-cultivation system can be designed using Synechocystis PCC6803 and Shewanella bacteria to reduce device complexity and operational costs. Additionally, for the cultivation medium, an industrial mechanism for purification and recycling can be developed to lower long-term costs for businesses. As for the reliance on systems, this project can be transformed into a waste gas treatment park that not only addresses emissions from power plants but also handles greenhouse gas emissions from chemical factories, landfills, residential areas, etc., providing broad application prospects in enhancing carbon sequestration efficiency comprehensively. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier in this document, with further technological advancements, this project could be applied in future urban development and play an important role in subsequent space exploration endeavors.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle" id="list5"> 2.Idea of industrialization</h2>
                        <p>To meet the application requirements of our project, we have designed the corresponding hardware component, which consists of two fermentation tanks for solid carbon fixation and electricity generation using microorganisms. However, in actual production and daily life, large-scale thermal power plants emit thousands of tons of carbon dioxide every day. The simple device we have currently designed cannot meet the current industrial needs. Therefore, we propose our industrialization plan.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4595/wiki/safety/safety3-1.png" alt="" class="normimg">

                    <p>We envision establishing a waste gas and wastewater recovery center around the thermal power plant, leveraging our project as the technological foundation. The above-ground area of the park will serve as the placement zone for transparent photobioreactors containing Synechocystis PCC6803, with multiple reactors being used to ensure optimal growth conditions for each strain. Additionally, we will adjust the inclination angle of these reactors based on the solar altitude at different latitudes to maximize light absorption and further enhance photosynthetic efficiency.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, a corresponding heat dissipation and transfer system will be established to provide the waste gas heat to the fermentation tanks of Synechocystis PCC6803 and Shewanella, replacing the current electric temperature control system, reducing power consumption, and improving energy utilization efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The park will also have an area dedicated to the fermentation tanks for Shewanella bacteria, with an underground facility and energy storage system. The significant amount of electricity generated by Shewanella bacteria will assist in supplementing the park's power supply as a part of its overall electrical supplementation. As the power generation increases, it will gradually be applied to meet the entire park's electricity needs, such as replacing cultivation medium devices and providing basic industrial power. Once the efficiency of electricity generation by Shewanella bacteria reaches a sufficiently high level, surplus power from the park can be transmitted through a grid to supply nearby industrial or residential areas. This provides a new pathway for biomass-powered electricity and further optimizes energy utilization structures during the dynamic process of improving or even replacing conventional thermal power plants.</p>
                    <h2 class="subtitle" id="list6">   
                        3.Vision of the future
                    </h2> 
                        <p>As the clean energy process accelerates, we foresee a gradual reduction and even complete replacement of the share of thermal power plants in the energy sector. In light of this, to ensure our project remains relevant in that future scenario, we propose our "vision for the future."</p>
                        <p>With the introduction and gradual construction of the concept of "future cities," we envision that our " Synechocystis PCC6803-Shewanella" system can be applied in future power systems. One of the most common designs is its application in "future streetlights": replacing the pole part of the streetlight with a transparent cultivation box containing Synechocystis PCC6803, connected to an appropriate ventilation system. Simultaneously, Shewanella fermentation tanks are integrated into the lighting body section as energy storage batteries. In this way, during daylight hours, Synechocystis PCC6803 can utilize roadside exhaust through the ventilation system for carbon sequestration and emission reduction while also providing acid to generate electricity for Shewanella. The stored electrical energy in these batteries can then be used for illuminating streetlights at night, thereby accelerating the clean-up process of future cities.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, as humanity embarks on its preliminary exploration of the universe, our ' Synechocystis PCC6803-Shewanella' system can also be applied in future spacecraft. We envision placing our dual-bacterial system in fermentation tanks aboard future space vessels and space stations. The S Synechocystis PCC6803 would absorb the carbon dioxide generated by astronauts and produce oxygen to replenish the respiratory systems of both the spacecraft and space station. Simultaneously, the electricity generated by Shewanella could provide power for essential operations in space engineering. This approach not only improves the lives of astronauts but also addresses energy scarcity issues within the universes.</p>
                        <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle3">CHALLENGES</h1>
                         <p>Currently, the successful integration of resistance genes into the project design has not been achieved. Therefore, we will redesign the plasmid construction for resistance components and continue to promote testing in this area, aiming to reduce the harmful effects of exhaust gases on bacterial strains.</p>
                          <p>Meanwhile, in terms of research and development, this project aims to explore a co-cultivation system between Synechocystis PCC6803 and Shewanella, with the goal of reducing the complexity of hardware construction and making the cultivation environment easier to achieve, thus further lowering costs.</p>
                           <p>Lastly, we hope to collaborate with thermal power plants for experimental testing on-site, in order to assess the feasibility of our current hardware design and microbial strains, address any shortcomings, and use this as a experiment foundation for the ultimate industrialization of our project.</p>
