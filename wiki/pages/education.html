                   <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle1">Section 1: Education</h1>
                        <p>In the course of our human practice activities, we recognized a significant deficiency in synthetic biology knowledge among non-biology college students and the general public. We committed ourselves to addressing this gap by organizing educational activities on synthetic biology. Our outreach efforts have spanned across various age groups within the younger generation, starting from primary school children, then middle school students, and finally extending to college students.
</p> 
                        <h2 class="subtitle" id="list1">1.1 A Science Lecture for Kids at Wuhan Museum of Science and Technology</h2>
                        <p>In our quest to ignite young minds with the wonders of synthetic biology, we had the pleasure of spending an enriching afternoon with children aged 5 to 12 at Wuhan Museum of Science and Technology on June 1, 2023. Here's an overview of our educational activity.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.1.1 Unveiling the World of Synthetic Biology: What Is It?</h3>
                        <p>Our first step was to introduce young minds to the field of synthetic biology in a way that was easy to understand. We employed an analogy, wherein the microorganism played the role of a factory responsible for accommodating and facilitating the operation of these genetic "machines" - the plasmids.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4595/wiki/education/education/education/education/education/figure1.png" alt="" class="normimg" >
                        <i class="imgexplain">Fig 1. Analogy: Microorganisms as genetic 'machine' hosts</i>
                        <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.1.2 Introducing the specific knowledge related to our project: <i> Synechocystis </i> PCC6803 and <i> S. oneidensis </i> MR-1</h3>
                        <p>We focused on two pivotal components within our project: <i> Synechocystis </i> PCC6803 and <i> S. oneidensis </i> MR-1. To introduce their application and arouse the children’s interest, we incorporated a board game into our educational approach. We provided the children with dice, and each roll determined the topic we would discuss. We described how <i> Synechocystis </i> PCC6803 can produce oxygen when exposed to sunlight and also discussed how <i> S. oneidensis </i> MR-1 can generate electricity once it gets its "food".</p>

                        <i class="imgexplain">Fig 2. Primary school kids actively participating in educational board games</i>
                        <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.1.3 Learning in a game: Creating your own "Synthetic Plasmid"</h3>
                        <p>We wanted the children to not just understand but also actively participate in the learning process. We prepared stickers with images of plasmid components like promoters, terminators, and genes. Using these stickers, the children were encouraged to create their own synthetic plasmids, following the rules of synthetic biology. This hands-on activity helped them grasp the intricacies of genetic engineering in a playful manner.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.1.4 Sharing Knowledge and Inspiring Curiosity</h3>
                        <p>At the end of our lecture, we encouraged the children to share what they had learned. We gave them the opportunity to express their newfound knowledge and enthusiasm for synthetic biology. Furthermore, we also interacted with their parents, explaining the importance of nurturing their child's interest in science and technology. We recommended various resources for parents to continue fostering their children's curiosity in the field of synthetic biology.</p>

                         <h2 class="subtitle" id="list2">1.2 A Summer Camp for Middle School Students</h2>
                        <p>In our efforts to foster early interest in synthetic biology and encourage more adolescents to pursue studies in this field, we organized an exclusive summer camp tailored for middle school students on our campus on July 20, 2023. We aimed to introduce them to the fundamental concepts of synthetic biology and provide guidance on basic microbiological experimentation.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.2.1 Introduction to Fundamental Concepts in Synthetic Biology</h3>
                        <p>Given that middle school students typically possess a foundational understanding of genetic engineering through their biology textbooks, we focused on systematically summarizing the entire genetic engineering process. This comprehensive overview encompassed the extraction of target genes, the construction of gene expression vectors, the introduction of target genes into recipient cells, and the subsequent detection and identification of these target genes.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.2.2 Guiding Middle School Students Through Microbiological Experiments</h3>
                        <p>During the camp, we equipped middle school students with the essential skills to effectively utilize microscopes. We carefully selected a diverse range of microbiological experiments for instruction, including Gram staining, and observation of yeast and black mold, all accompanied by detailed explanations of experimental principles.</p>

                          <h2 class="subtitle" id="list3">1.3 A debate regarding synthetic biology ethics for college students</h2>
                        <p>To promote an understanding of synthetic biology ethics among college students, we organized a debate that brought together students from various academic disciplines at Huazhong Agricultural University. This event aimed to provide fundamental knowledge of synthetic biology to a diverse audience and facilitate meaningful discussions with iGEM team HZAU-China.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.3.1 Explain fundamental concepts in Synthetic biology</h3>
                        <p>Considering that our audience consisted of students from different fields, we took care to explain synthetic biology concepts at a college student's level. This approach ensured that all attendees could grasp the biological content discussed during the debate. </p>
                        <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.3.2 iGEM project presentations</h3>
                        <p>To provide concrete examples of synthetic biology applications, both iGEM teams, HUST-China and HZAU-China, presented iGEM projects to the audience. After hearing about the "C.A.T: Cat Allergic Therapy" project from HZAU-China and “Electrico Sisters” project from HUST-China, attendees gained insights into this year's iGEM projects in various tracks.</p>
                         <h3 class="subsubtitle">1.3.3 The Debate</h3>
                        <p>The central question of our debate revolved around the ethical considerations in the rapidly advancing field of synthetic biology: In the current rapid development of synthetic biology, should we adopt a creator's mindset towards life? iGEM HUST-China argued against the idea that we should play the role of a creator, even though synthetic biology enables the creation of organisms with characteristics that are not naturally present. On the contrary, iGEM HZAU-China supported the opposite viewpoint. This debate delved deep into the ethical dilemmas accompanying the evolution of synthetic biology, fostering valuable insights and sparking heated discussions about synthetic biology ethics among the college audience.</p>

                    <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle2">Section 2: Communication</h1>
                        <p>We engaged in communication activities that reach both within our own country and across international boundaries, including a close exchange with one particular team and active participation in opening conferences as well as nationwide competitions alongside various iGEM teams.</p>
                   <h2 class="subtitle" id="list4">2.1 Exchange with the iGEM Team WUST-China</h2>
                        <p>On May 18th, 2023, we actively participated in a deep conversation with the WUST-China iGEM team. This exchange provided us with an opportunity to pose questions and collectively seek solutions to challenges.</p>
