                   <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle1">Overview</h1>
                        <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, the amount of highly endothermic greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that humans emit into the atmosphere has been increasing year by year, and the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere has also been enhanced, triggering a series of increasingly serious climate crises. What’s more, the combustion of fossil fuels in thermal power plants is the main source of carbon dioxide, up to one-third.</p>
                        <p>So we designed an electricity generation system for co-culture of Cyanobacteria and Shewanella oneidensis. The Cyanobacteria use solar energy to absorb carbon dioxide and produce lactic acid. At the same time, Shewanella oneidensis takes lactic acid transported by cyanobacteria as its carbon source and oxidizes it completely to generate the power.  </p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we understand that thermal power plants generate a large amount of waste heat. If the waste heat can be used to cultivate our strains, we can not only reduce greenhouse effect but also improve energy efficiency. </p>
                        <p>In order to improve the carbon sequestration and electricity production capabilities of our co culture system, we focus on modifying the two strains, especially increasing the intracellular NADH concentration of them.</p>
                    <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle2">Chassis strains: Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1</h1>
                        <p>Cyanobacteria are a group of organisms characterized by aerobic photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide fixed by them is stored as a polysaccharide in cyanobacteria cells and metabolized into various compounds. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is the earliest model cyanobacteria to be sequenced completely, which is also a commonly used substrate cell for photosynthetic carbon sequestration and production of chemicals such as lactic acid. We will use the lactic acid produced by Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for electricity production in Shewanella.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4595/wiki/safety/safety3-1.png" alt="" class="normimg">
                        <p> Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is one of the most widely studied model microorganisms in the field of bioelectrochemistry. It is also an electricity producing strain that uses electrodes as electron mediators for extracellular electron transport. And its ability to use a wide range of electron receptors for growth respiration has received extensive attention. In particular, in terms of electricity generation, s.oneidensis MR-1 can use lactic acid as its respiratory substrate and oxidize it completely under anaerobic conditions. And then s.oneidensis MR-1 transports electrons through cytochrome proteins and transmits electrons to the electrode through direct contact in the end. s.oneidensis MR-1 preferentially utilizes D-lactate, and the maximum current density is positively correlated with the concentration of D-lactate. In addition, s.oneidensis MR-1 enable to use self secreted quinone derivatives or flavin electron mediators to indirectly transport electrons to the electrode as well.</p>
                    <h1 class="sectitle title-cover" id="sectitle3">Strategy 1: photosynthetic carbon sequestration in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803</h1> 
                        <p>In order to solve the greenhouse effect, we are supposed to improve the carbon fixation ability of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, so that they are able to continuously absorb the carbon dioxide to photosynthate carbon fixation to produce lactic acid, and transport the produced lactic acid to the extracellular space.</p>
                        <p>Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 itself lacks a pathway to produce lactic acid. In the meantime, as a photoautotrophic microorganism, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is also short of a lactate transporter to transport lactic acid out of the cell. Therefore, we introduced lactate dehydrogenase and lactate transporter protein to produce lactate and transport the produced lactate to the the extracellular layer of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.</p>
                        <p>The lactate dehydrogenase gene we selected is ldhA, which endows Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with the ability to produce lactic acid. Lactate dehydrogenase A is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reverse conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid.</p>
<p>
NAD+ and NADP+ mainly act as not only coenzymes of dehydrogenase but also the hydrogen transmitters in enzymatic reactions. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, due to the fact that the NADPH molecules produced by photosynthesis far exceed the NADH molecules produced by catabolism, NADPH is the major form of reducing equivalent in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. 
</p>
 <p>
 However, the activity of NADPH is not as high as that of NADH, for this reason most dehydrogenase enzymes tend to use NADH as a cofactor. Therefore, sufficient NADH supply is significant for the production of dehydrogenase derived chemicals in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
 </p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, the physiological environment with low NADH/NADPH ratio places restrictions on the application of NADH dependent dehydrogenase in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Consequently, how to increase the concentration of NADH to provide enough NADH for the production of lactic acid, in order to increase the production of lactic acid and facilitate the subsequent increase in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 electricity production, is an urgent problem that we need to deal with.
  </p>
<p>
  At the same time, we introduced the lldP gene to express lactate transporters, which are used to transport lactate out of cells.The LldP protein has 12 transmembrane alpha-helical segments, which can effectively transport lactic acid. Furthermore，this lactate transport process is dependent on proton kinetic potentialp, which means it also requires us to increase the photosynthetic efficiency of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
  </p>                      
<p>As a consequence, we have brought in the gene omcS encoding electron transfer proteins into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to change the direction of intracellular electron transfer and promote their photosynthetic efficiency. The appearance of Omcs can conduct the electrons to produce more ATP from photoreaction, increase their proton kinetic potential, and raise the concentration of NADH concurrently.</p>
                       
                        <p> The pathways of photosynthetic electron transfer are mainly divided into linear electron transfer (LET) and cyclic electron transfer (CET). In the process of LET, electrons are ultimately transferred to NADP+ through photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f), and photosystem I (PSI) to produce NADPH, and also a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane is formed to drive ATP synthase to produce ATP. Besides the LET, as auxiliary, CET cycles electrons from the PSI acceptor side back to plastoquinone (PQ), cytochrome b6f (cytb6f) complex and plastocyanin (PC), generating ATP without net NADPH production to meet metabolic demand. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 also have respiratory electron transfer(RET), where the NADH generated from the catabolism of organic carbon donates electrons to generate ATP for sustaining cell growth or cellular activities, resulting in low intracellular NADH concentration and no additional NADH available for chemical productions involving NADH dependent dehydrogenase. Therefore, we are able to decline the concentrationo of ATP produced by RET by increasing that produced by photosynthetic electrons, thus saving NADH consumed by RET. </p> 
                        <p> To solve these problems, we introduced a redox protein called C-type outer membrane cytochromes which encodes by gene omcS from Geobacter sp. into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Regulating LET and CET is crucial for efcient photosynthesis and enhancing CET can drive LET as well as photosynthesis. As the most abundant mobile small electron carrier, PQ is shared by LET, CET, and RET[7]  in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The introduced OmcS directs excess electrons from PQ to PSI to stimulate CET and drive LET to regulate the ratio of ATP and NADPH, leading to three effects: </p> 
                        <p> (1) improves CET, which increases ATP production. </p> 
                        <p>(2) improve LET, which increases both ATP and NADPH production during photoreaction to meet metabolic needs. </p> 
                        <p> (3) represses RET, which enables NADH to accumulate that otherwise will be respired to generate ATP, thus leading to an increase NADH level to improve the activity of lactate dehydrogenase. </p>
