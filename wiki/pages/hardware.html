                <p>
                    To help our Cyanobacteria and Shwanella symbiose and further achieve our goals, we built such a fermenter for cell culture. We formed this complete fermenter with partitions, making it suitable for our Cyanobacteria and Shewanella cultures and easy to split and assemble. From the outside, our fermenter is like a small mushroom that is breaking out of the ground, and we hope to use it to represent new life and the future. At the same time, we have prepared sterilization equipment at the outlet of the tank to ensure that our engineered bacteria will not escape into the environment. We designed such a fermenter to help further improve and complete the experiment.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    B. Structure
                </h2>
                  <p>
                      The fermenter innovatively puts forward the idea of "building block" fermenter, through the modular design, improves the operation portability and environmental adaptability of the fermentation system, and customizes the corresponding solutions for different fermentation scenarios to ensure maximum efficiency. The system provides optional modules including: stirring module, defoaming module, temperature control module, air distribution module, pH monitoring module, aerobic/anaerobic module, lightless/lighted module, and monoclonal/synergistic module. Another advantage of the modular design is the cost, which only requires the price of normal 3d printing. After obtaining the whole fermentation model family, the parts can be replaced at will, realizing the completion of industrial simulation at a cheaper price and higher fit.
                    </p>

                  <p>
                      This semi-spherical fermenter is designed specifically to optimize the growth of Cyanobacteria, with a primary focusing on increasing their light receiving area but also ensure its volume. The tank boasts a total height of 15.5 cm, and we employed transparent materials in order to enhance both light efficiency and transmittance, thereby promoting better photosynthesis by the Cyanobacteria. To further support optimal culture conditions for these organisms, we included a spiral tube for temperature exchange, which allows for the inflow of thermal wastewater or thermal waste gas generated from power plants to maintain the desired temperature within the fermenter. We also prepared another four small holes on the top of the tank, one for adding culture medium，one for adding waterproof exhaust valve to balance the air pressure in the tank,one for placing temperature sensor and another for placing PH sensor. In consideration of the need to connect the filter membrane、flow switch and anode tank beneath the fermenter, we incorporated external threads at its base. These threads serve not only to facilitate this connection but also prevent potential water leakage.

                  <p>
                      This anode pot, measuring 8.2 cm in height, is utilized for the cultivation of Shewanella.The upper surface of the tank features two circular openings - one serves as a connection to the Cyanobacteria culture tank above, while the smaller one is designated for the anodal elrctrode, and left the corresponding inner thread for the anode cover. The remaining openings are concentrated on one side of the tank, with the large threaded mouth serving as the point of connection for the cathode tank,the 4 cm diameter opening is more conductive to proton exchange. To facilitate the embedding of the proton membrane, a 1mm-wide gap has been left around the grid, which also acts as a safeguard against membrane damage.The small hole at the bottom of the pot is designed for waste medium discharge, while the side bend serves to input carbon dioxide,keep the anaerobic environment and maintain air pressure within the tank.
                    </p>

                      The counterpart of the anode tank is the cathode tank.We have also designated the position of the cathode plate on top, and left the corresponding inner thread for the cathode cover.The threaded connection on the side bears similarities to that of the anode tank, with the exception of the opposite thread direction and omitting a 1mm width.The thread in the opposite direction ensures that the cathode and anode tanks can be connected at the same time without inversion problems when installing the proton membrane connector.

                      In order to better achieve the symbiotic relationship between Cyanobacteria and Shewanella, we have incorporated three components between the Cyanobacteria fermenter and the Shewanella anode tank to facilitate the addition of a membrane filter while preventing leakage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The first component is the No.1 filter plate, with one side equipped with a carbon dioxide entrance.Carbon dioxide is first passed into the Shewanella anode tank to ensure its anaerobic environment, and then bypass the flow switch partially through to the cyanobacteria fermenter to participate in the reaction of cyanobacteria.This ensures that the cyanobacteria can also be given sufficient carbon dioxide when the flow switch is turned off, and the design of feeding the carbon dioxide from near the filter membrane allows the gas to blow up the cyanobacteria deposited on the filter membrane. Both sides of the No.1 filter plate are equipped with threads, with the upper thread connected to the Cyanobacteria fermenter and the lower connection to the No.2 filter plate.
                    </p>
                  <p>
                      The bottom-most No.2 flow switch has a similar fan-shaped structure as that of the No.1 flow switch, with its lower thread connecting to the Shewanella anode tank.Its side surface also has a conduit, which can ensure that when the flow switch is closed, gas can be introduced into the Cyanobacteria fermenter to maintain an anaerobic environment.
                    </p>

                      We also have a separate connecting pipe designed between the cathode tank and anode tank. It has completely symmetrical positive-reverse thread structure. And since the screw starting point of the cathode and anode tanks is the same but with opposite rotation direction, we can separate them without rotating the tank body to replace the proton membrane.

                      The cathode, like the anode, is equipped with a threaded electrode cover to ensure that the culture medium does not flow out of the electrode port and can easily replace the electrode. In addition, each cover has 2mm holes, leaving room for the insertion of the electrode in advance.

                  <p>
                      Considering that the initial addition of media requires a faster rate of adding samples, but the subsequent replenishment of media requires the use of catheters for continuous adding samples, and requires a closed internal environment, we set a large feeding port on the cyanobacteria fermenter, and equipped it with a corresponding connecting port for the use of catheter sampling. This is also in the form of threads to ensure better tightness.

                    Our hardware also needs to realize the detection of the growth condition of the medium, such as temperature, ph value, etc., and also according to the temperature to control the in and out of the hot air to ensure the appropriate temperature of the medium, as well as according to the ph value to control the replenishment and flow of the medium.
                      <br>
                      Therefore, we built a set of simple control board based on STM32F103C8T6 master to realize these functions.

                      The wiring diagram on the breadboard is as follows:

                  <p>
                        In the temperature acquisition section, we have used DS18B20 module.The DS18B20 module provides 12-bit temperature readout with a temperature range of -55° to 125°. The temperature information is sent to and from the DS18B20 via a single wire interface. Therefore, only one wire (and ground) needs to be connected from the CPU to the DS18B20. The power required to read, write, and complete temperature conversions can be supplied from the data line itself, and no external power supply is required.
                        <br>
                        The DS18B20 stores the temperature value in 12 bits, with the remaining high bits being sign bits. All 1s are negative and all 0s are positive. Thus the DS18B20 can achieve an accuracy of 0.0625°.

                        For the hardware connection, the DS18B20 needs to be connected to a temperature probe for data acquisition, and itself needs to be connected to a 3-5V supply, ground, and a data cable.

                        For the PH detection part we chose a PH sensor module.

                        The module is connected to the PH composite electrode through a BNC connector and expanded with a DS18B20 temperature sensor interface, which is convenient for the software to carry out temperature compensation design. Adjusting the 10K blue potentiometer can be adjusted for amplification.

                       Before using the PH sensor, we need to use the two-point calibration method. Since our medium environment is acidic, the PO port output voltage can be measured in a standard buffer with a pH of 6.86 and a pH of 4.00, and then a V-PH curve can be fitted in EXCEL based on these two points, from which the pH value of the medium can be calculated.

                        Our solenoid valve is a normally closed type, with an operating voltage of DC12V.
                        <br>
                        Since the maximum output voltage of STM32 is limited, in order to drive this 12V solenoid valve, we need to borrow an external 12V battery (of course, in the future, after the industrialization of maturity, we can realize the self-sufficiency of the power supply), an NMOS FET, and a 10K pull-up resistor to form a driver circuit.

                  <p>
                        PA6 is the microcontroller output pin. In order to utilize the microcontroller to output 12V, we configure the output mode of PA6 pin as open-drain output mode to realize that when the output is low, the output is 0, the NMOS tube is cut off, and the solenoid valve is closed; and when the output is high, the output is high resistive so that the NMOS tube is turned on, and the solenoid valve is opened.
                        <br>
                        The value of PA6 determines the opening and closing of the solenoid valve, and the microcontroller judges the value of PA6 according to the acquired information such as temperature and PH value to realize the entry and exit of hot air and the replenishment of culture medium.
